Who's that cell line? (web tool)

Oh no! You have a cell line that lost its label, meaning it could be one of thousands in your database. 
This webpage lets you upload you own database to search against (export an excel sheet as a .csv and submit the file), and you can submit multiple queries the same way.

You will receive the top 3 matches for each query, along with their match scores. 

Choose between 3 algorithms, Tanabe, Masters v. Query, and Master v. Reference.
